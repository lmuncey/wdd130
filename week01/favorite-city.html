    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Salt Lake City, Utah. It is a beautiful city that is located just minutes away from some of
        the most amazing mountains and other natural features. It maintains a great balance between modern and natural
        elements. It is also my home, both literally and figuratively. I have traveled to many places in my life, but
        Salt Lake City remains my favorite city.</p>
